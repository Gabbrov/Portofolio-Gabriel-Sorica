			<H2>A bit about me: </h2>
			<p>I am Gabriel Sorica, an aspiring Software Developer. I enjoy a multitude of tasks within software development, although my favourite would have to be Game Development or simmilar projects, where I am able to see how each and every line of code changes the end result and allows me to see how each mistake or error can affect the end result in real time. While it might be a questionable quality, I enjoy failing repeatedly to learn from said failuires.</p>
			<p style="padding-top: 10;">As you can see below, I have experience in working with a few programming languages, such as:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#python">Python</a></li>
				<li><a href="#java"> Java</a></li>
				<li><a>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</a></li>
			
			</ul></p>

			<h2><a id= "python">Python</a></h2>
			<p>My Latest Python 3 project is a CV builder, using openAI's GPT 3.5 library to generate human like descriptions for CVs, targeted to customised job descriptions. Currently I am going trough an overall in design, after my discusion with Bournemouth University's Placement advisor. Some changes coming from this discussion include a complete overhaul in design. Some details will remain the same from the original design. </p>
			<p style="margin-top:1%;">The final product shouuld have multiple modes, from Cover letter write up, to automatic apply using emails and the default CV write up. As it stands there seem to be some quite obvious issues, first one being the gathering of company and employer details, since GPT might provide outdated information. Another apparent issue is GAI detection and the fact that at times it is quite obvious. To counter this I decided to add some extra prompt information to try to steer the AI from using words that would not otherwise be used by the averge person. At the moment this seems to be working fine, however some further testing is required.</p>

			<p>Curently a big majority of the code on this website is self made, with help from W3 Schools and Stack Overflow for the code formatting. The purpose of this website is to demostrate my skills in programming as well as to constantly improve further on said skills. At the moment I am not too satisfied with the design of web page(mostly the color scheme). In future iterations of the website I plan on adding some sort of feedback request to further improve on the website. I also plan on adding a few animations in places, since the website feels a bit static at the moment.</p>
